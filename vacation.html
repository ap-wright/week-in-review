      <h2>About Sweden</h2>
        <h2><i>Population</i></h2>
          <p>There are 10 million people in Sweden, of whom about 2 million are under the age of 18. Eighty-five percent of them live in cities. Sweden is a very multicultural country: 15 per cent of Swedes were born in another country, while about one in five children in Sweden has a family with roots in another country.</p>

          <h2><i>Geography</i></h2>
            <p>The capital of Sweden, Stockholm, is also the country’s largest city, with more than 930,000 inhabitants. Other large cities are Gothenburg, in western Sweden (population 550,000), and Malmö (population 300,000) in the south. Uppsala and Lund are well-known university cities.
              Less than three per cent of Sweden’s land area is built up and forests cover 69 per cent of the country. Sweden is long – some 1,574 kilometres from top to bottom – and can be divided into three major regions: Götaland in the south, Svealand in the middle and Norrland in the north.</p>

          <h2>Nature in Sweden</h2>
            <p>The Northern Lights dance across the skies in Arctic winter and the Midnight Sun illuminates the nights in the summer months. From the mountains of the mighty north, to the white sandy beaches of the temperate south, we have space for everyone.</p>

          <h2 class="text-success">The right of public access</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the first thing you should know about the great outdoors of Sweden is that you have almost total access to it because of something we call 'the right of public access' which is written into the Swedish constitution. It entitles you to roam freely and camp overnight, even on private land and you can also forage for berries and mushrooms. But you do have to treat flora, fauna and other people's property with care.  It's not a bad deal -is it? </p>

          <h2>The foodie canal - A great trip idea!</h2>
            <p>Here’s a way of experiencing the culture and traditions of the canal, while tasting the best the region has to offer at farm shops and small local producers in West Sweden. It’s called ‘the canal to coast’ food trip and is organized by Norrqvarn Hotell & Konferens in Lyrestad, on the canal, and Pensionat Styrsö Skäret on the island of Styrsö in the Gothenburg archipelago. Both are Taste of West Sweden-accredited. The idea is this; you book the package and get to stay at one or both hotels and you decide which end you want to start at. You are given a map that details all of the great farm shops and local producers you can visit and off you go. You can taste your way from the Göta Canal all the way out to the coast, and everything in between.</p>
